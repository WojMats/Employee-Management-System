This project is an employee management application. Here are its main components:

1. **File Structure and Classes**: The project consists of several Java files and classes as well as FXML files that define the user interface layout.

2. **Classes `HelloApplication`, `HelloController`, `Service`**: These are the main classes of the application. `HelloApplication` extends the `Application` class from JavaFX and defines the `start()` method, which initializes the user interface. `HelloController` handles user interactions and events. `Service` contains the business logic of the application, such as adding, removing, and modifying employees and employee groups.

3. **User Interface**: It includes FXML files defining the graphical user interface. In this project, the `TableView` control is used to display employee and employee group data.

4. **CSS Styles**: The project also contains a CSS file defining the styling of the user interface, such as background colors, button styles, etc.

5. **Data Operations**: The `Service` class manages employee and employee group data. It handles operations such as adding, removing, modifying, sorting, and searching for employees.

6. **Warning Messages**: The project uses the `Alert` control from JavaFX to display warning messages to the user, for example, in case of incorrect login attempts.

7. **Data Initialization**: Employee and employee group data are initialized in the constructor of the `Service` class for demonstration purposes.
